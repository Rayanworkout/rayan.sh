    <h1 class="text-center">About me</h1>
    <p>I am a 26-year-old self-taught software developer based in Marseille, France, with a passion for creating
        efficient and scalable solutions.</p>
    <p>Specializing in Backend Development and DevOps, my expertise lies in designing robust server-side applications
        and optimizing system operations for enhanced performance, integration and reliability.</p>
    <p>My primary programming languages are Python and JavaScript, both of which I have extensively used in various
        projects to build dynamic web applications. Additionally, I use Rust and Java for projects that require high
        performance or low-level system programming.</p>
    <p>If you're seeking a skilled backend developer or a seasoned DevOps engineer, whether for remote collaboration or
        on-site services within Marseille, feel free to <a href="mailto:rayan13170@protonmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>
