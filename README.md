# My personal website

Made with React and Vite, hosted on Vercel.

It follows the [jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard, it means that you can use your own json resume to generate your own website.

Inspired by [this website](https://github.com/jcoelho93/personal-website) but remade from scratch.

Feel free to fork / use with your own json resume.
