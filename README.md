## Purpose
#### The main goal of this website if for me to learn FullStack Web development best practices, acting as a part of my learning journey. Additionally, it serves as a platform to showcase my projects and share small tutorials to assist others.

## Tech Stack
#### - Framework
#### Crafted with Nuxt 3, VueJS, and Typescript, it offers essential elements for a dynamic web experience. Utilizing server-side rendering ensures efficient content delivery.
#### - Server
#### I've leveraged Nuxt's built-in Nitro server to create fast and reliable API endpoints, protected by rate limits and including authentication for some.
#### - Hosting and CI/CD
#### Hosting the website on a Debian VPS, served with PM2 behind an Apache reverse proxy, ensures stability.
####  The CI/CD pipeline is fully automated and lightweight, triggered by a Flask server listening for GitHub webhooks.
#### - User Authentication
#### I've implemented secure user authentication with Supabase.
#### - Database
#### The databasz is currently a postgres database from supabase but I will soon migrate to a self hosted local SQLite database with Prisma ORM.

## Markdown Support
#### Articles are composed in Markdown and seamlessly transformed into readable HTML with code syntax highlighting.
